# Holly's personal website project, a WIP

## What I hope it will be:
* part blog, part intro to me
* a project I can be proud of
* not brutal to look at


## Next steps
* add more images, but not all stacked on top of each other ✔️
* get the GitHub and Slack links to be clickable images
* add sub-pages for About and Blog ✔️
* update text to say more about me
* more pictures!
* dynamic text on main page/something to make it not so boring
* a menu on the side ✔️
* first blog post!

## This is my first forray into web development using simple HTML and CSS.
